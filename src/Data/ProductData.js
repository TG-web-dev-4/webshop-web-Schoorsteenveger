        "story":"Back in 1852, James Yankee Jim Robinson was hung by his neck for the crime of grand larceny. A few years later, Thomas and Anna Whaley built a house on the spot where Robinson died, and soon enough, Yankee Jim's ghost showed up, haunting the site. It's said that his footsteps can be heard clumping around the house. Yankee Jim isn't the only visitor, both Mr. and Mrs. Whaley, a young girl, and even the family dog have been known to make appearances from beyond the grave. The house is so thoroughly spooky that, according to TIME, in the 1960s, the U.S. Commerce Department classified the Whaley House as haunted.",

In the early '90s, new renters Debra and Tony Pickman claimed they saw strange occurrences in the house, including lights flickering, apparitions, possessions, unexplained voices, and strange scratches, marks, and burns on their bodies. These occurrences seem to have been the work of a ghost of a young girl, named Sallie. Former renters Bobby and Colleen Humbard and their daughter Heather also claimed to have seen or heard Sallie, whom Heather claimed was her imaginary friend. But apparently, Sallie isn't some harmless ghost. Theories around her malevolent presence in the house, as well as some evidence of Satanic rituals in the basement, suggest that Sallie is, in fact, a demon disguised as a young girl.",

        "story": "he Biltmore Hotel in Coral Gables wasn't always a hotel, It was built in 1926 by a young developer named George Merrick. Known as the founder of Coral Gables. The hotel became a place to host glamorous fashion shows, galas, golf tournaments and water shows in what was then the largest pool in the world. At a loud party on the 13th floor of the hotel, a gangster named Thomas Fatty Walsh was shot and killed by another gangster. That murder yielded a lot of ghost rumors over the years. Then World War II happened and the federal government transformed the Biltmore into a military hospital. Once the war was over, it continued being a hospital for veterans. In 1952, the University of Miami made the Biltmore its first home. When the hospital closed in 1968, the Biltmore became an abandoned shell. ",
        // "story": "The house's haunted history is documented in author Jan Bryant Bartell's Spindrift: Spray from a Psychic Sea. It all began when young actress-poet Jan Bartell moved with her husband into the old Greenwich Village Townhouse once inhabited by Mark Twain.  At first there were only the strange phenomena of unexplained shadows and sounds, and a presence that seemed to clutch at her in the dark. Then the deaths started, claiming one after another of the building's occupants. This is the story of Jan Bartell's discovery of a diabolical possession she first could not believe, then could not deny. It is the story of her fight against it, and her eventual flight from it.Jan Bartell's flight was in vain. One month after finishing this extraordinary true story, the author was found dead, and the pattern of horror was complete.",

With a history reaching back to 1836, when it was first settled, it is not surprising that the City of Crystal Lake, Illinois, claims its fair share of ghost stories and reports of paranormal activity. According to local stories, the Palmer House is the center of ghostly activities such as the sounds of children stomping on the floor, scratching at the door and crying. Locals report seeing apparitions of children's faces appearing periodically in the windows in the basement. According to hauntedhovel.com, the faces of the children have appeared on a select number of photographs. The stories of the hauntings stem from the history of the house, which was built in 1858. Through the years, the house was passed down through the Palmer family and eventually sold. Reportedly, one of the house's owners ran an orphanage there where he beat and allegedly killed some of the children.",
